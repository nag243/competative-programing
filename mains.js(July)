// What are the three phases of event propagation ?
// ANS : Capturing > Target > Bubbling
// The event first goes down through the parent elements until
// it reaches the target element(capturing phase).
// When the event reaches the target it triggers there(target phase),
// and then goes back up the chain(bubbling phase), calling handlers along the way.
