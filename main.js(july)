What are the three phases of event propagation?
Capturing > Target > Bubbling
The event first goes down through the parent elements until
 it reaches the target element (capturing phase). 
 When the event reaches the target it triggers there (target phase),
and then goes back up the chain (bubbling phase), calling handlers along the way.
